	<h1>You expect a lot. We deliver more.</h1>
	<p>We know that no two houses are the same, so there's no reason cleaning services should be the same, either. At Merry Maids, our team members take the time to listen and understand your needs. When you request a quote, one of our expert representatives will work with you to create a custom cleaning program that will fit both your lifestyle and your budget. If you ever have any concerns or need to make changes to your service, our friendly office staff are only a phone call away.</p>
	<h2>The team you can trust.</h2>
	<p>Before ever wearing the Merry Maids name, potential applicants are carefully screened. This process insures that the individuals we hire, and those that you have in your home, are truly dedicated to providing you with a job well done. Training - no team member enters your home without it. In fact, each new employee, despite background or prior experience, is required to attend a comprehensive training program. It is only upon completion of this program that the new team member becomes certified to clean.
