	<h1>Merry Maids Franchises</h1>
	<p>If you are looking for a business opportunity with a thriving future and solid support from a trusted company, a Merry Maids cleaning franchise is for you. With more than 30 years of experience, Merry Maids is the world leader in the residential industry with more than 900 cleaning franchises in the U.S. and Canada, and more opening all the time.
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Cleaning Franchise Market Profile</h2>
	The most precious commodity today is time. People are starved for it and increasingly willing to pay for services that afford them more leisure. The number of dual-income families keeps growing. More than 70 percent of women in the United States now work outside the home. Plus, the maturing baby boomer population has disposable income and better things to do than clean house. Industry experts predict demand for maid service will continue to grow at an accelerated rate as time-starved consumers continue to buy time-saving services well into the 21st century. The combination of these factors, along with Merry Maids experience and name-brand awareness, makes us the leader in the industry.
	<br>
	<br>

	The Merry Maids unique professional home cleaning system combines efficient two-person cleaning teams with effective management and proven marketing procedures. Regardless of your previous experience, our systematic approach to training, cleaning, office management and developing your customer base can give you the confidence to succeed with your own home cleaning franchise.
